# GAME-ADVENTURE-SAngband
SAngband is a "graphical" dungeon adventure game using textual characters to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, in the vein of "rogue", "hack", "nethack", and "moria".  There are no character "classes" in SAngband; characters become more powerful by using experience to advance "skills."
